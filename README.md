Finding anagrams for Persian words:

To find out if a permutation of the entered word is meaningful, I use an online Persian word finder: www.vajehyab.com

Input: a Persian word

Output: for every permutation, the result of Vajehyab is printed - two set of words is printed*

*Note: The result of the Vajehyab may not be 100% meaningful in Farsi because this site also searches through some Arabic sentences.
So in the result we have a set of words ("100% Words") that we are almost sure they are meaningful, and we have some words ("50/50 Words") that Vajehyab finds something for them in its database but we are not sure if these words are really meaningful in Farsi.
